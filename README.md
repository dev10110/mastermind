# Mastermind

A small repository with a complete mastermind game.

Built in response to an interview challenge from [SimplifyNext](https://www.simplifynext.com)

Fully implemented using [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [EJS](https://ejs.co).
The front-end css uses [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com).

[Live demo](https://mastermind-dev.herokuapp.com) deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

This is also my first express app and first Heroku deployment so any feedback will be appreciated!
